University of Mississippi student Mary Kate Cornett trends after allegations of an affair spark controversy.

University of Mississippi student Mary Kate Cornett became a trending topic on X, formerly Twitter, on February 26 after allegations surfaced that she was involved in an affair with her boyfriend’s father. The controversy has gained significant traction online, with social media users widely discussing the claims and even creating a meme coin inspired by the situation.

According to a viral post shared by X user @MAGAgeddon, Cornett allegedly became intimate with her boyfriend Evan’s father, identified as Private Banker Erik Solis. The post referenced a screenshot of a Snapchat message claiming that Cornett had returned home early after completing her exams. She reportedly took Evan’s younger sister to a basketball game, accompanied by Evan’s father. Later that evening, Cornett and Solis allegedly went out for drinks, which led to the start of their alleged affair.

Further claims in the viral post suggested that Solis reassured Cornett about his history of infidelity, stating he had cheated on his wife multiple times. Speculation also indicated that Evan eventually discovered the affair, but he and Cornett later reconciled. Meanwhile, Solis’ wife was reportedly aware of the situation but was considering divorce for unrelated reasons.

As the scandal gained momentum, X user @DuragRebel shared screenshots suggesting the creation of a cryptocurrency meme coin based on Cornett’s name. The screenshots also included allegations reinforcing the claims against Cornett and Solis.

Additionally, X user @Baginpocket posted an alleged screenshot of Cornett’s Instagram profile before it was made private. Other social media users shared unverified claims suggesting she had engaged in similar behavior previously, with one screenshot appearing to show a $150 Venmo transaction allegedly made to keep someone from revealing details.

At the time of writing, none of the parties involved had publicly addressed the allegations.
